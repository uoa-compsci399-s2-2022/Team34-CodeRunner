Spatial Skills Testing is a project about implementing tests to gauge an user's spatial skills and produce data for analysis. One of the project's component was to implement additional questions into the University of Auckland's exising CodeRunner platform to extend its current questions repository.

This is a repository containing assets used for the CodeRunner component of Team34's Spatial Skills Testing Project.


The file "questions-COMPSCI.373.C.S1.2022-CS399 Team 34 Questions-20221023-1438.xml" is an exported file from CodeRunner using the Moodle XML format that contains all the implemented questions into CodeRunner.

Each Folder corresponds to one of the 3 category of spatial skills. 

Each folder contains assets used to create the quiz in CodeRunner.

Answer Key documents contain the correct answers to the questions.

Spatial or Visuospatial Perception: Drawn by Daniel Gildea, Kayles Holmes-Albert, Rawiri Mahue. Edited by Ethan Lin.

Spatial Visualization: Edited by Ethan Lin.

Future Plan: Since CodeRunner's design is by UoA's development team, Team34 has no ability to influence its future releases. However since the existing CodeRunner platform can easily accomodate more questions, if more are created they can be added into the database.
